Change the compilation of tokyo cabinet itself:

If doing large number of records at a time, change HDBXFSIZINC to use much
larger block sizes when extending the .tch file.

If using the delayed record items, you can build up a larger buffer of data
before committing by changing the HDBDRPUNIT option.
